# AI Code Reviewer Using Open AI
### Description:
This project leverages Streamlit to create a user-friendly error analysis tool powered by OpenAI. It allows users to paste a code snippet, and OpenAI analyzes the code, identifying potential errors and providing explanations. The tool then displays the results in a Streamlit app, making the analysis process interactive and informative.

### Tech Stack:
- Python >= 3.9 
- Streamlit
- Openai

### Getting Started:
#### Prerequisites:
- Ensure you have Python and Streamlit installed. (pip install python streamlit)
- Create an OpenAI account and obtain your API key from the OpenAI platform (https://platform.openai.com/signup).
- Clone or Download the Repository: Clone this repository or download the project files.
- Configure OpenAI API Key: In your project code, replace the placeholder with your actual OpenAI API key. Important: Do not commit your API key to a public repository.
- Run the App: Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run ```streamlit run app.py``` (replace app.py with your actual script name). This will launch the Streamlit app in your web browser.

### Further Development
- Enhance the user interface for a smoother user experience.
- Integrate error correction suggestions based on OpenAI's analysis.
- Support different programming languages (if applicable).

`#### Note` : OpenAI has usage limitations (potentially free tier or billing considerations). Make sure to check their documentation for details and adjust your application accordingly.
